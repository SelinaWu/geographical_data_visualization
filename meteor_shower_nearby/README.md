## meteor_shower_nearby
The project aims to create a web application that allows users to discover asteroid/metroid events nearby, 
create asteroid watching events/meetups, and share photos and leave comments regarding an astronomical event. 
The app contains the ability to observe past astronomical events on a 3-D earth model (adapt from D3 into React), 
look at available future meteorite sightings, create skywatching events/meetups and leave photos regarding these 
sightings.

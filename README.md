## meteor_shower_nearby
The project aims to create a web application that allows users to discover asteroid/metroid events nearby, create asteroid watching events/meetups, and share photos and leave comments regarding an astronomical event. The app contains the ability to observe past astronomical events on a 3-D earth model (adapt from D3 into React), look at available future meteorite sightings, create skywatching events/meetups and leave photos regarding these sightings.
